I am a zookeeper. I take care of the animals. I feed them and make sure their happy, but it is pretty complicated to make sure that every animal gets their specific food 
that they like and the perfect amounts. It is hard for me to keep track when to feed the animals and how much each animal has to eat.  
We would like to record all these information.



The cage number, the animal type, name of animal, the day they were born, the age of the animals, meals, treats,  Pounds per day, time of day that meal is given, 
date they got their treats,  how often do they have to fast, date they last fasted
